# Tech

### Javascript
Project was built with Javascript to leverage browser's asynchronous Event Loop and DOM event handlers to minimize concurrency and maximize
performance
### CSS
All game pieces and board were custom styled to give game a retro feel. Pacman was animated using CSS keyframes to simulate 'eating'.
### Netlify
This game is hosted with Netlify. Netlify is a serverless cloud deployment experience which makes Continuous Deployment a breeze by connecting to this github repository.
### Parcel
Due to the small project size, Parcel was the perfect choice for a bundler.
